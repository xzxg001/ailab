1679#Ses02M_impro04_F002#train/Ses02M_impro04_F002.wav#Right, so the fact you doing the best that you can is -#2
1680#Ses02M_impro04_F003#train/Ses02M_impro04_F003.wav#you know you shouldn't give yourself a hard time for that, it's the best you can.#2

1688#Ses02M_impro04_F010#train/Ses02M_impro04_F010.wav#That's- I mean. There are more factors then just whether you're good or not, you know what I mean like#2
1689#Ses02M_impro04_F011#train/Ses02M_impro04_F011.wav#and the fact that you know there is always different types of things and what kind of people they want in the office and whether it's male or female or you know what I mean, like things are out of your control.#2
1690#Ses02M_impro04_F012#train/Ses02M_impro04_F012.wav#So you should take that in consideration rather than giving yourself such a hard time.#2

1692#Ses02M_impro04_F014#train/Ses02M_impro04_F014.wav#You know and the fact you still here and still cooking, like it's good that you're thinking about it, that you're reconsidering.#2
1693#Ses02M_impro04_F015#train/Ses02M_impro04_F015.wav#But like, just because you're considering why it's been so difficult doesn't mean you should just stop.#2
